# Air-Fight-AI

##  There are three optional game modes:
##      1. Real player
##      2. Rule-based AI
##      3. Deep reinforcement learning AI

### Rule-based AI\
I adapted flock algorithm to this specific scenario. Hero takes action based on two rules: avoidance and attack.\

### Deep Reinforcement Learning AI\
I implemented a Deep Q-network to control the hero.\
